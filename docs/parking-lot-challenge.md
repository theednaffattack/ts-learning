# Parking Lot Challenge

## Challenge Requirements

For this challenge, you have to implement a class in JavaScript. That class should consist of variables and methods that simulate how a parking lot works. Here are the details:

- We should be able to create the parking lot with a given size (number of parking spots)
- We don’t differentiate between different vehicles – we consider them all the same
- Our class provides a method for parking new cars in the parking lot
- Our class provides a method for removing already parked cars, and
- Our class provides a method for getting the size of the parking lot (total count of slots)
